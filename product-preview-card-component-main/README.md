I'm excited to share my third challenge/project using the FrontEndMentor platform to practice and hone my skills. This project was another learning points, as there were many things in theory that I had not had the opportunity to apply on a project, but the product review card afford me that opportunity.

I had to learn a few new things espcially with Flexbox. I got to understand the use of flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex flex basis and how they can be used to manipulate the size, position and growth rate of particular flex items.

It was a bit fun to compel myself to work with relative units (rem) as against using absolute units (px) which could be a problem in responsive design.

I'm excited to share this code and I'm proud of my learning. The resourcefulness and critical thinking required to make the design as pixel perfect as possible was fun. I'm still hoping to grasp more javascript concepts soon.

Cheers and Happy New Year.

Thanks for reading
